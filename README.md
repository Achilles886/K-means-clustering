# K-means-clustering
The goal of this project was to use data science techniques to investigate whether it is
possible to automatically identify fake banknotes based on their measurable features.
By analysing data about individual banknotes, we aimed to determine whether there are
clear di>erences between genuine and counterfeit notes and whether a computer
algorithm can be trained to distinguish between them.
